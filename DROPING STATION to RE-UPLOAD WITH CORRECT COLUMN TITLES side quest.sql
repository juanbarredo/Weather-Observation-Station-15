--ok, 
--I need to plan this pomodoro
--I need to change the name of the column (LON_N) to (LON_W) in the STATION table
--this means that I have to errase the table.

--and re-upload it.
--re-upload it using the import/export wizard.

--let me look up how to delete a table.

USE Weather_Observation_Station_2;
DROP TABLE STATION;


--Ok,
--I failed at uploading a new table with the correct name
--but the column title I need to change is LON_N to LONG_W.
--very different.
